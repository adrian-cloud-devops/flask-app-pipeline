# **Flask Todo App ‚Äì CI/CD on AWS**

1. Introduction

This project demonstrates a complete CI/CD pipeline on AWS for a sample Python Flask application.
The application is deployed on EC2 instances managed by an Auto Scaling Group (ASG), behind an Application Load Balancer (ALB). The deployment process is automated with AWS CodePipeline, CodeBuild, and CodeDeploy.

To ensure reliability and observability, the project integrates Amazon CloudWatch for monitoring (CPU usage, Nginx error logs) and Amazon SNS for alert notifications.

üéØ ### **Project Goals**

- Build a production-like DevOps pipeline using AWS services.

- Learn how to connect multiple AWS components into a working end-to-end deployment.

- Demonstrate scalability, monitoring, and alerting on a real web application.

üõ†Ô∏è ### **Technologies Used**

- AWS: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy, EC2, ASG, ALB, CloudWatch, SNS

- Python: Flask web application (REST API + HTML)

- Nginx: Reverse proxy (port 80 ‚Üí 5000)

- GitHub: Source code repository
